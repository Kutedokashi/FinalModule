        Hello! It is a pleasure to greet you, my name is Eduar Trujillo and
        <br />
        today I am going to talk to you a little about my abilities and skills.
        <br /><br />

        When I was a child I discovered my passion for computers, exactly when I
        <br />
        first played League of Legends, the game from which no one escapes
        <br />
        (LMAO). <br /><br />

        Since that day I discovered my ability to use the computer and learn to
        <br />
        shorten time using keyboard shortcuts. <br /><br />

        This same skill took me further by getting me curious and taking my
        <br />
        first computer apart and completely putting it back together and getting
        <br />
        it working again.
      </p>
