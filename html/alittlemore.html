                Tailwind is a CSS framework that provides a set of prebuilt <br>
                classes for designing and styling web pages. Unlike other CSS <br>
                frameworks that focus on visual components, Tailwind focuses on <br>

                Tailwind's classes are organized into <br>
                categories such as spacing, typography, colors, grid layouts, <br>
                and more, making it easy to use to design and develop web pages <br>
                quickly and efficiently. In addition, Tailwind allows you to <br>
                easily customize the values ​​of CSS variables to create custom <br>
                and consistent branding. <br><br>
                
                Tailwind integrates well with other <br>
                popular frameworks and tools, such as React, Vue, Next.js, and <br>
                more, making it a popular choice among web developers.
